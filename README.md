# This is a test project.
### Here we use a mock router cissgo to emulate an ssh connection to a cisco device
### We use netmiko to connect to the device and then parse the output
### After parsing the output is fed to two rest api endpoints respectively
### The api endpoints are called by a web app written in html frontend and Flask at backend
